# Pair Programming

#### Learning Objectives
- Explain the uses of pair programming
- Pair program using a process to solve programming problems

### Intro

THIS IS A CHANGE

### Main

Scrabble [requirements](./requirements.md)

Decide on who starts as Driver and who starts as Navigator
- Driver **forks** this repository
- Driver **clones** their fork to their machine
- Navigator **clones** the Driver's fork to their machine
- Driver adds their pair partner as a [collaborator](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository)
- Driver [opens a PR](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) back to the Boolean UK repository

1. Driver passes a failing test!
2. Driver **stages** and **commits** changes and **pushes** to their forked repository
3. **Switch roles!**
4. New Driver pulls the new work
5. Repeat steps 1-4 until the challenges are complete.

### Discussion

- What did you takeaway?

### Resources

- [Pair Programming Guide](https://tuple.app/pair-programming-guide/template)
- [Update your fork](https://gist.github.com/CristinaSolana/1885435#gistcomment-2857738) with new changes


### Further work
Pair on completing the exercises in [further-work](./further-work). The exercises start off simple and scale in complexity. Take your time and discuss your approach with your pair partner before starting work.
